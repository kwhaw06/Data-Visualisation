# Problem set 2 â€• README

**Context:** Consider the [dataset used in Koop and
*Tobias](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/data-viz-smm635/tree/master/data/koopAndTobias),
*which concerns the relationship between schooling and wage at the individual
*level.

**Task**: Create a Matplotlib figure that illustrates:

-   the univariate distributions of the following variables: 'EDUC', 'LOGWAGE', 'ABILITY', 'MOTHERED', 'FATHERED', and 'SIBLINGS';
-   the bivariate distribution of any possible pair of the above-mentioned variables;
-   submissions should build on Matplotlib only (that is, I won't accept Seaborn code);
-   to do the job, you can use as many 'ax' as you want;
-   the figure should fit an A4 page, landscape layout;
-   the audience is 'Dr. Asimit' - the visualization has to be included in the final year dissertation BA students have to deliver.

**Submission**: Submit your solution via email to simone.santoni.1@city.ac.uk.
Late submissions (> October 21, 2020) may not be considered for the in-class
presentations.
