# Problem set 1 ― README

**Context:** Consider the [dataset used in Koop and
Tobias](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/data-viz-smm635/tree/master/data/koopAndTobias),
which concerns the relationship between schooling and wage at the individual
level.

**Task**: Create a scatter diagram that illustrates the economic returns of
schooling to a generalist audience with a taste for minimalism ― say, the
readership of the New York Times.

**Submission**: Submit your solution via email to simone.santoni.1@city.ac.uk.
Late submissions (> October 14, 2020) may not be considered for the in-class
presentations.
